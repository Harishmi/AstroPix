# AstroPix
Users can view Astronomy picture of the day(APOD) from NASAâ€™s open APIs ( https://api.nasa.gov/ ).

I didnt use any third party libraries.

Users can view the Astronomy picture of any particular date. And the corresponding data will be stored to coredata.

Just after application loads, it will show the APOD of present date. 

Users can add any APOD to their Favourites and they can check all of their favourites in the Favourites tab.
